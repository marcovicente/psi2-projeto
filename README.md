# Projeto em Sistemas de Informação (PSI 2018)

## Getting Started ##

### Product Vision
* What is the product
 “The minimum plan necessary to start a Scrum project consists of a vision and a Product Backlog. The vision describes why the project is being undertaken and what the desired end state is.” (Schwaber 2004, p. 68)

* Who is the target customer? Who is going to buy/use the product? 
* Which customer needs will the product address?  
* Which product attributes are critical to satisfy the needs selected, and therefore for the success of the product?  
* What are the benefits and key features
